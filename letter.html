                    To my brilliant, hardworking man,I AM YOUR #1 BIGGEST FAAAAN 🤩

                    That day when you patiently explained everything about reading drawings and calculating density, I was honestly super, duper, deeply impressed. I felt so happy and truly shocked by how smart and calm you are, boo 🩷
                    You know what, sayang? There are a lot of smart people in this world, but not many who can actually teach others. And with you, I can really see the difference. The way you explain things slowly, step by step, always thinking about how to make it clear for me!! even if you have your own way of processing it, that’s such a rare and special skill. I’m seriously addicted to learning from you now, my baby 🥹
                    I miss our It Takes Two moments so much!! 🥺Playing together, failing a hundred times, but always ending up laughing and feeling proud together. You were always so patient teaching me every little thing in that game. You never got annoyed, never harsh.  you were soft and gentle with me. And that’s something I love so deeply about you.
                    I’m so proud of every project you handle at work.The responsibility you carry, the focus, the late nights, the way you lead and solve problems, it all inspires me, boo. I love seeing how committed you are to your dreams, your career, your future. Watching how passionate you are, even in the smallest things, makes me look at you and think:
                    “Wow… that’s my man.” 😭🩷
                    And I get so happy seeing your photos at the F1 circuit in Dubai, or watching your livestreams playing PS, FIFA, or go-kart. I don’t fully understand everything about it, but seeing you enjoy what you love makes me happy, sayang. It makes me proud of the life you’re building and the joy you choose for yourself.
                    And I’m also so proud of you for taking care of yourself going to the gym, pushing yourself to grow stronger, choosing a healthier lifestyle, and even being aware of skincare and treating yourself with love. It might seem simple, but it means a lot. It shows that you value yourself, your body, your health, and your well-being. That makes my heart so happy, boo 🤍

                    And something I cherish so much:the way you apologize softly and respectfully when something feels wrong.You don’t shout.You don’t blame.You’re gentle.And that softness shows how beautiful and mature your heart is.
                    Thank you for being patient with me.Thank you for explaining things with love.Thank you for letting me learn you, piece by piece.Thank you for making me feel safe, heard, and understood.
                    I’m endlessly proud of you, boo.Always cheering for you, always supporting you, always loving you.
                    With all my heart,Putri again, me, and always me ❤️

                    Hi boo,If you’re opening this, maybe you need a smile today.  so here are some of our funniest memories, to bring back your smile and laughter 💗
                    We were so confident we were going to a beautiful tea garden, ready for aesthetic photos and peaceful green views… and instead we ended up walking in circles around random people’s houses 😭😭Literally a neighborhood tour HAHAHA
                    I still remember looking at you and we both just like, “thats it???????” and got confused.

                    And then when you got chickenpox…HAHAHA you looked like a little kid confused and itchy but not allowed to scratch 🥹I felt so bad for you, but it was honestly the funniest thing because your face was so dramatic and adorable at the same time 😭❤️

                    And our poop updates every morning 💩😂“pooping now sayang” somehow became our serious daily topic LMAOOO i love that sayaangg. Who else bonds over poop like that? HAHAHA.

                    I also laugh so much when you speak Indonesian slowly like you are reading a school ceremony script jee🤣 It’s cute and funny in the most natural way.

                    And the office gossip. We literally laughed so hard, just roasting situations and people HAHAHA🤭

                    And you singing “bobo di mana, bobo sama siapa” with that cute face but deep voice😭I swear I wanted to pinch you, it was so stupidly funny boo 😭❤️❤️

                    I still remember how happy (and lowkey funny) it was when you let me follow your second Instagram account HEHEH
                    And laughing at vids with your college friends that I didnt even understand but still joined in HAHA priceless 😂

                    But what I love the most is this:During our hiking to curug, and you tell me stories about your past, your falling experiences😭 the incidents, from your life. We always end up laughing at something somehow. And that makes me feel like I know you deeper, layer by layer boo. 

                    Thank you for being the person I can laugh with about literally anything. Even the dumbest things.That’s one of the biggest reasons I love you, my baby 🤍

                    If today feels heavy, remember: We survived a fake tea garden scam, chickenpox struggle edition, and a poop update championship 🤣
                    We can survive everything else too.
                    Now smile for me babyyy! 😚I love you always sayaaaaang 🩷

                    You're Safe with Me

                    Boo, If you’re opening this, maybe today you’re feeling unsure, overwhelmed, or not enough. So let me remind you of something important my love. You are more than enough. Not because you’re perfect, not because you never make mistakes, but because your heart is beautiful, your intentions are pure, and you try, truly and deeply, and that matters more than anything.
                    I know you carry so much on your shoulders, boo. I know you push yourself harder than anyone else does, and I know sometimes you feel like you’re not doing enough, not achieving fast enough, not being strong enough. But sayang, listen to me carefully. You don’t have to be strong all the time. You don’t have to keep everything together alone. You don’t have to earn love by being perfect.
                    You deserve love even on your worst days, boo. You deserve support even when you feel weak. 
                    
                    You deserve someone who stays, and I’m staying, sayang. On the days you feel insecure, I want you to know this: I’m not going anywhere. I’m here, holding your hand through every fear, reminding you of who you really are when you forget.
                    You are kind. You are talented. You are capable. You are chosen. You are loved, deeply and truly, sayang. And I know we will face hard seasons. We will misunderstand each other sometimes. We will get tired, frustrated, and scared. But even then, boo, I will choose you. Again and again, every time. Always.
                    You never have to hide your insecurities from me, my baby. Your softness is not a weakness🥹 it is a gift. Your vulnerability is safe with me. So breathe for me, boo. You’re doing so well. More than you realize. And I’m proud of you, sayang. Always.
                    With all the love I have,MEEEEE! 🩷

                    I just want to remind you of something simple but important. Whatever happens in the future, whatever challenges come, whatever changes life brings, I’m right here with you. We’re a team, and we’re walking forward together.
                    I know life will keep giving us new responsibilities, new dreams to chase, new problems to solve, and new mountains to climb. And maybe sometimes it will feel overwhelming or uncertain. But don’t forget sayang, you don’t have to face anything alone anymore. You have me now. And I’ve got you, always.
                    I’ll support you through every goal you want to achieve, every dream you’re building, and every step you take toward the life you want. I’ll stand beside you when things are exciting and when they’re challenging. I’ll cheer for you on your best days and hold you steady on the hard ones.
                    Whatever the future looks like boo, I want to face it with you. 
                    
                    I believe in you. I trust you. I’m proud of the man you are and the man you’re becoming. And I will keep choosing you, every day that comes.
                    We’ll grow together. We’ll learn together. We’ll build something beautiful together.And no matter what, sayang, remember this: you’re not alone. I’ve got you. Always.
